# Don’t Buy a Kitchen Countertop Until You Read This!  
### A Manufacturer’s Guide to Getting the Right Countertop – Without the Headaches

## Introduction: Choosing the Right Custom Countertop Manufacturer is Everything

Looking to upgrade your kitchen or fit out a new space? Don’t make the mistake of rushing into buying countertops without understanding what to look for. Many homeowners and shopfitters opt for generic surfaces or big-box deals—only to regret it weeks later when issues like bubbling, warping, or poor sizing arise.

We’ve seen it time and again. One customer, James from Randburg, picked a “budget” countertop from a warehouse store. Within months, it showed signs of water damage and edge peeling. Eventually, he turned to us at **DRT Laminating**—and we custom-built the postform countertops he actually needed, at a fraction of what repairs would’ve cost.

This guide will show you how to choose the right manufacturer, avoid common pitfalls, and ensure your countertops look amazing *and* last for years.
